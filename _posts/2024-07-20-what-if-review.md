## What if? is what happens when the inner child in you gets a degree in physics. The book is quirky, hilarious, and best of all, utterly bonkers.

The book has a simple basic premise. What if a man decided to use science to answer all the unanswerable crazy questions people have? How feasible is it to build a transatlantic bridge out of lego? Can I build a jetpack by firing several guns downwards at once? How much force power can Master Yoda output?

All these questions get tackled in a beautiful manner by applying elementary physics to them. As the author once said, “Physics doesn’t care if your question is weird. It just gives you the answer, without judging.” This to me is exemplary of the sheer beauty of science. We develop simple, comprehensible rules and equations, that are capable of predicting the world around us. We then play within the boundaries of these rules, and see where they take us. If something useful emerges out of it, we have successfully engineered something new. If we find a mess or a contradiction, we refine our ideas, reframe our thinking, and start again. Even if nothing of any practical use comes out, we learnt something new today. Science has no mandate to be useful.It is in essence, an exercise in organised curiosity. This book takes that philosophy to extreme lengths, showing us all a little bit of that joie de vivre that science can give us. 

In addition, the varied nature of the topics covered and their breadth across various sciences, means that there is almost always a little inside joke of sorts for proponents of any subkect. It makes reading the book feel like the experience of diving down a rabbit hole, or prospecting for gold, never knowing when you will find a diamond in the dirt. It truly gives reading its own feeling of adventure, as you are always on your toes, wondering when the next gem is coming.

### Exhibit C: Square sun, round hole

Ultimately, the book is a fantastic must read, especially as an antidote to anybody who finds their inner child starting to quieten, or their curiosity about the world around them starting to diminish

PS: The author's opening spiel about absurd units is one of the most entertaining and soul-touching pieces I have ever read. It gave me fresh kinds of fear and anxiety that I never even knew existed. Beware the kilo cubic feet per second.
