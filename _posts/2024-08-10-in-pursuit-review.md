## In pursuit of the unknown is some of the most fun I have ever had studying complex mathematical topics.

In Pursuit of the Unknown is a book by the amazing mathematician Professor Ian Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick. The book masterfully describes how mathematics runs through the core of all the things we take for granted. Seemingly simple and mundane equations, like Pythagoras' theorem, or logarithms, that many people treat as mathematical curiosities, actually have many more layers of depth to them than they realise.

Every chapter is dedicated to the complete study of one equation. It starts with a statement and breakdown of the equation, and explains what the equation does and what it led to. The author then dives further in depth, exploring the historical circumstances that led to their formulation. Subsequently, he explains how the equation evolved over time and finally, how it was applied to different fields. 

The best part of the book is how the author makes simple topics deep, and complex topics simple. For example the pythagorean theorem. Every student has covered it at some point during their middle school career. At the time it seems to just be a fairly simple statement about relating the sides of triangles to each other. Not particularly useful outside of a maths textbook. 

>a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup> <br>
where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lenths of the other 2 sides.

However, Professor Stewart quickly dispels such misguided notions, by exploring how the theorem led to the development of trigonometry, and from there to more accurate surveys. He then shows how, by starting from trigonometry and euclidean axioms, we can work our way upwards to describe non-euclidean geometries and hyperbolic space. From there he starts to explore n-dimensional space, and as a coup-de-grace defines gravity in terms of geometry - Einstein's celebrated theory of General Relativity. 

This exploration of the applications of the equations is to me, the most important component of the book. I personally feel that mathematics should not be a closed system of theorems that echo back onto each other. The true beauty of maths is how neatly it can help us predict and work with the world around us. From modelling gravity to modelling financial systems, maths is the core thread that makes understanding any complex system possible. We have the luxury of living in a universe that obeys simple laws; simple, universal, *mathematical* laws. It is a glorious gift to humankind, a gift whose value the book helps us appreciate. 

My only criticism of the book is that some of the more complicated chapters do require the reader to have some amount of mathematical knowledge, in order to appreciate the full depth of the equations. However, this issue is relatively minor, as the references do a solid job of explaining some of the more obscure and difficult mathematics.

In summary, I feel that this book is a fantastic read, and is a must have for anyone wanting to gain a deeper appreciation of the role mathematics plays in our lives.
