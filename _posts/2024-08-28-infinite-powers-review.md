Seeing that Infinite Powers had received glowing testimonials from 2 of my favourite mathematicians (Hannah Fry and Ian Stewart), I decided to give the book a shot. I was not expecting a wild ride through several centuries worth of mathematical and scientific thought. It shows us a glimpse into the minds of the geniuses who founded whole new domains of scientific researches. Archimedes, Newton, Fermat, Wallis, all these names echo through the book, giving us deep insights into how the calculus we take for granted today first came about.

The book opens with the idea of the infinity principle:
> To shed light on any continuous shape, object, motion, or phenomenon -no matter how wild and complicated it may appear- reimagine it as an infinite series of simpler parts, analyze those, and then add the results back together to make sense of the original whole.

Once the principle is laid bare, it strikes a sense of awe into the reader. It is hard to distinguish whether it is genius or madness. In a way,  the story of calculus as a whole follows a similar pattern of mad genius. The great pioneers applied intuition first, logic later. The mathematical consequences of fooling around with infinity could be dealt with later, what mattered were the results. 

And boy, were the results fantastic. The founding fathers of calculus found that the great books of mathematics and physics were suddenly open for them to read. Newton and Leibniz found that that they could calculate the great intractable problems of the day: how to deal with curves, and how to deal with motion. In particular, Newton found that by applying his work to the vast realm of physics, he could generate wondrous and fantastic results. His breakthroughs resulted in the publication of the Principia Mathematica, his magnum opus, and one of the greatest books in history. Steven Strogatz does a fantastic job of explaining just how revolutionary and powerful calculus was at this stage. Reading his description feels like being taken through a candy shop filled with mathematical goods.

The book ends on a sombre note, however. It points out how a huge number of problems are now in the very precarious situation of being almost unsolvable by the human intellect. They behave chaotically, meaning that mathematically approximating their behaviour becomes very innacurate very fast. At the same time, they require higher dimensions to analyze, meaning that it becomes incredibly difficult to work with intuitively. Our brains are constrained to the three spatial axes that we experience daily. Even adding a fourth dimension, like time ( Einstein's theory of relativity ) makes things far more complicated to visualize. Meanwhile, models like string theory work with eleven dimensions, and the three body problem mentioned in the book requires eighteen. 

Steven Strogatz suggests that these problems are now falling to the share of computer scientists instead of mathematicians. Algorithms are able to prove such theorems where human intuition fails. The four colour theorem was the first major theorem to be proven by computer instead of by hand. It met with significant controversy however, as having a proof which was almost impossible for humans to verify, meant that instead of gaining a deeper understanding of the theorem and why it is true, mathematicians simply had to accept the computer's word for it. For many, this defeated the purpose of the exercise. The book posits that eventually we may end up in a situation where we simply sit at the feet of a computerized oracle, and accept its word as fact. The world of computerized mathematics may be coming, whether we like it or not.
