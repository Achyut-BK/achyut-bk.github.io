Given that the last few books have all been about how great and glorious maths and science are, and how they have pushed humanity forwards; I thought it would be apt to temper the tone with a quick look at a book on mathematical follies and hubris, by the hilarious Matt Parker, of Stand-up Maths fame.

> 2 x 3 = 5

If I had a dollar for every time I made that mistake, I would be a millionaire. The fact of the matter is, mathematical mistakes happen quite frequently, and happen to almost everyone. From the youngest schoolchild working with algebra, to the top scientists working on cutting edge technology, all of us have messed up our calculations at some point or the other. Matt Parker's engaging stories about how mathematical screw-ups affected computing, science, aeroplanes, and finance shows us one crucial thing when it comes to errors: We are not alone.

This acts almost as a balm, showing that your errors are relatively small when it comes to the grand scheme of things. Mistakes will happen, the important thing is to not sweat about the details and the issues. Simply focus on moving on, and learning from them. The best example he provides about this is in bridge design. Bridge engineers learnt about factors like resonance and torsional instability by going iteratively. Every time a bridge failed, its lessons were incorporated to build new, better, stronger bridges. To me, that is humankind's biggest strength. We can improvise, adapt, and overcome any problem. Even if one idea fails, we come back with a thousand more to make it work

In conclusion, the book as a whole is a worthwhile read, acting as the mathematical equivalent of comfort food. Matt Parker's fantastic dry humour is on full display, and really helps tie the whole thing together. December 10th book, no comments


<small>As an aside, the number of maths-based inside jokes makes it an almost xkcd-esque experience to read. You never know when the next perfectly placed punchline is going to hit.
