<p>Hi! My name is Achyut BK, and I am a student in grade 12, based out of India. I am really passionate about Physics, Maths, and Information Processing, and would like to pursue Engineering in college. I am also a classical guitarist ( Grade 8, with merit, TCL ), and a strong workaholic. </p>

<p>This site is my space to discuss various ideas and opportunities I had, and share cool resources to the world.</p>
